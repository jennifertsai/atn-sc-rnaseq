# Single Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis of the Anterior Thalamic Nuclei ðŸ§¬ðŸ§ 
The goal of this project is to identify a specific population of neurons that participates in memory within the anterior thalamic region in the brain. To do this, high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing analysis is used to map out a molecular-cellular landscape of the ATN.

## Techniques and Tools Used
The Seurat package within R and RStudio is used to perform linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction, clustering, gene marker finding, and visualizations! The Ggplot2 library was used to create custom data plots of gene markers and the graded variation gene expression across clusters.

## Integrations
This analysis was furthered by integrating it with VISUM and MFISH to determine the spatial locations of the cells on the brain!
